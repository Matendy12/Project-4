MOVIE RECOMMEND SYSTEM

      Supervised Learning and Linear Regression

DEFINE PROBLEM

A movie viewer is continuously scrolling through movies to view for 10-15 mins or possibly more. This can be discouraging to a viewer when their main goal is to find a movie to watch that interest them. If the problem persist it could possibly cause the viewer to look elsewhere for movies or cancel membership if they are not able to find movies of interest at a reasonable amount of time (5-10 mins).  

To solve the issue for the viewer and movie provider, a movie recommend system is constructed by using machine learning.

OBJECTIVE
The objective is to construct a movie recommend system that predicts movies to watch based on viewers past history.  The movie recommend system will notice a movie based on past viewing history, select a movie with a high correlation, high rating and high rating count.  A movie with a high correlation, high rating and high rating count is predicted a good movie to watch.  The movie recommend type is content based filtering and it suggest similar items based on a particular item.  This system uses item metadata, such as genre, ratings, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations.  The general idea behind this recommender system is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.

MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM

   Scikit-learn also known as Sklearn, is probably the most useful library for machine learning in Python. The sklearn library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine 
   learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.
