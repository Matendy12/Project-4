# Project-4

OBJECTIVE

A movie viewer is continuously scrolling through movies to view. This can be discouraging to a viewer and possibly cause membership cancellation if they are not able to find movies of interest at a reasonable amount of time (5-10 mins).  The objective is to construct a movie recommendation system that predicts movies to watch based on viewers past history.  Content based filtering suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, ratings, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind this recommender system is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.
